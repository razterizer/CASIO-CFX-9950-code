1. SUMMARY
----------

This collection contains programs to demonstrate different ways to
make use of FX-GL and FX-GLUT. It is similar to the OpenGL red-book
in setup.

Refer to the file fx-gl_ex.txt document for more information.

File sizes are estimated for the CFX backend only.


Enjoy!

4. ADDITIONAL NOTES
-------------------

Following is information from Roy F.A. Maclean regarding program text
conversion. It is taken from a post at UCF (www.casiocalc.org).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

What follows below is about using Casform to do the conversion.

I think it's best to just use search..replace.. in a text editor
to change unrecognised symbols into CTF.

To get FX-GL to work in Casform:

Search for
&
replace with
\10^

E Exponential operator (wherever appropriate).

This can be replaced using regular expressions.
e.g. 5E5 can only mean the EXP button as E5 with a variable would be a syn error.

Using the editor TextPad (http://www.textpad.com/)
which has regular expressions:

Search for
\([0-9]\)E\([0-9]\)
replace with
\1\\exp\2

Using E for the EXP button is something I could add to Casform
although it would only work for positive exponents:
e.g. 5E-5 could not be distinguished from 5*E - 5.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To get the program titles in CTF form to make the output easier to read
I used regular expressions in TextPad:

Search for
--.*$
replace with
@@ Program

then

Search for
\(^.*$\)\n@@ Program
replace with
@@ Program "\1"

This changes for example
GLCYLNDR
--------
into
@@ Program "GLCYLNDR"

This doesn't change the output of each program, it just means you can
paste the whole lot into Casform in one go and it is easier to pick out each
program area from the output for copying.
