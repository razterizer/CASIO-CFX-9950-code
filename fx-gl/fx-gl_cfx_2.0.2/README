1. SUMMARY
----------

FX Graphics Library is a graphics API for Casio graphing calculators.
It currently has support for the CFX series calculators and the
FX-9860G calculator.

This API allows you to render graphics in (near) real-time.
It is developed to mimic OpenGL as much as possible even though the
platform (calculator) is totally different from a desktop computer.
If you have experience in OpenGL programming, this API will be easy to
learn.

Refer to the fx-gl.txt document for more information.

File sizes are estimated for the CFX backend only.

Besides from the FX-GL API, this package also contains the following
appendicies:

* A tutorial on how to make an FPS engine.
* A comparison between OpenGL drawing modes (glBegin(...))
  and their FX-GL counterparts.


Enjoy!

          * GLLOOKAT  - Sets the camera/view matrix.
          * GLPRJMAP  - Projects vertices/points and maps them to the viewport.
   5. Rendering: (880 B)
          * GLINITP   - Enables the point drawing mode.
          * GLINITL   - Enables the line drawing mode.
          * GLLINE    - Draws a line that can be partially outside of
                        the screen.
          * GLDRAW    - Draws a sequence of lines or points by using an
                        edge list.
          * GLFDRAW   - Quickly draws a sequence of lines or points.
                        Faster than GLDRAW

4. ADDITIONAL NOTES
-------------------

Following is information from Roy F.A. Maclean regarding program text
conversion. It is taken from a post at UCF (www.casiocalc.org).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

What follows below is about using Casform to do the conversion.

I think it's best to just use search..replace.. in a text editor
to change unrecognised symbols into CTF.

To get FX-GL to work in Casform:

Search for
&
replace with
\10^

E Exponential operator (wherever appropriate).

This can be replaced using regular expressions.
e.g. 5E5 can only mean the EXP button as E5 with a variable would be a syn error.

Using the editor TextPad (http://www.textpad.com/)
which has regular expressions:

Search for
\([0-9]\)E\([0-9]\)
replace with
\1\\exp\2

Using E for the EXP button is something I could add to Casform
although it would only work for positive exponents:
e.g. 5E-5 could not be distinguished from 5*E - 5.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To get the program titles in CTF form to make the output easier to read
I used regular expressions in TextPad:

Search for
--.*$
replace with
@@ Program

then

Search for
\(^.*$\)\n@@ Program
replace with
@@ Program "\1"

This changes for example
GLCYLNDR
--------
into
@@ Program "GLCYLNDR"

This doesn't change the output of each program, it just means you can
paste the whole lot into Casform in one go and it is easier to pick out each
program area from the output for copying.
